# Dementia-Analysis.
Introduction

When thinking, memory, and reasoning skills are lost to the point where they interfere with day-to-day tasks, this condition is known as dementia. Some dementia patients have emotional instability and personality changes. The intensity of dementia varies from the mildest stage, when it is just starting to interfere with a person's ability to function, to the most severe level, when the individual must fully rely on others for fundamental daily activities.

Currently, there are no cures for these diseases.

The five most common forms of dementia are:

Alzheimerâ€™s disease, Frontotemporal dementia, Lewy body dementia (Olu Jacobs), Vascular dementia, Mixed dementia,
**Aim and Objectives**

The aim of this project is to build a machine learning model to predict chances that a person will have dementia and the probable type they can have.

The specific objectives includes:
1.   Data gathering from a public repository (kaggle)
2.  Data preparation, EDA and transformation
3.   Training three (3) machine learning models on the  prepared and transformed data
4. Evaluation of the model performance
